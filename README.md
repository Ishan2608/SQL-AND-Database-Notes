# SQL-AND-Database-Notes
Here are my handwritten revision notes of the SQL and Database Bootcamp course, on Udemy, by ZeroToMastery Academy. I know these will be useful to you.

I took a course on Udemt by ZTM Academy. A wonderful course I would recommend to all. These are the notes I have made for everyone, who wants a resource through which they can have a quick revision.
